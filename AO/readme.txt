1.
There had to be some input parameters for initial population like number of filters which has been asked in input
We also have added prompt as well as cooments on each input step


2.
On each generation newly created networks were being evolved and save on the same directory which have been moved to all models folder

3.
We have saved top10 individuals from population at the final generation to be saved in directory named "top10ind"

4.
Graphs being created will get saved to graphs folder.

5.
Best fit from population will be saved in "best_fit_trained" folder after final training.

For each input prompts have been added and comments are there in the code
Remember that there are two kind of epochs one for number of epochs for evolving network and one for final training of selected individual.
